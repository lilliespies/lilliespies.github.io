      <h1 class="reverse">What Are My Interests?</h1>
      <p>
        My interests include different things depending on the environment. Outside of school and
        work, I enjoy reading, along with casual drawing and sketching. On top of these, I also
        enjoy relaxing and enjoying my time off from work. While I'm at work, I move as fast as 
        possible, in such a way to leave at an optimal time.

      <h1 class="reverse">Plans After High School</h1>
      <p>
        First, before I finish high school, I plan to obtain a license in pharmacy technology. 
        This would in turn act as a job during college. After high school, I don't have a set
        plan as to what I want to do in my future. Although, if I go through with the pharmacy 
        technician plan, that would allow me to keep a steady income throughout college.

      <h1 class="reverse">What I've Learned In Class</h1>
      <p>
         I've learned a lot. This six weeks, I have learned two to three major concepts.
         First is converting decimal numbers to binary. As well as binary to ASCII. 
         Next to that, I learned how the internet works. Namely networking. Lastly, we 
         covered and learned how to create a website.

      <h1 class="reverse">About My Family</h1>
      <p>
         My family is somewhat complicated. Nevertheless, family is important. I value
         people that respect me. If a family member, or anyone else for that matter, doesn't 
         show me basic respect just because I'm younger, or a female, they don't have my own 
         respect.
